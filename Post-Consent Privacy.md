# **From Consent to Context: An Analysis of the Origin, Evolution, and Conceptual Foundations of 'Post-Consent Privacy'**

## **Introduction: The Crisis of Consent and the Rise of a Post-Consent Paradigm**

The modern digital ecosystem is built upon a foundational legal and ethical principle: consent. From the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) to various state-level laws in the United States, the dominant paradigm for data protection rests on the "notice and choice" model.1 In theory, this model empowers individuals by presenting them with information about data collection practices and allowing them to make a rational, autonomous choice to grant or withhold their consent. This framework promises to balance the data-driven ambitions of technology firms with the fundamental right to privacy. In practice, however, this model has devolved into what many scholars now consider a "beautiful lie"—a system that creates a pervasive illusion of user control while simultaneously enabling and legitimizing an economy of mass data collection and consumer exploitation.3 The very act of clicking "I agree" has become, as one academic analysis puts it, "the biggest lie on the internet," a ritual devoid of genuine understanding or choice.3  
The manifest failure of this consent-centric regime has precipitated a crisis in privacy governance, creating an intellectual and policy vacuum. In response, a new conceptual framework is emerging, broadly defined as a "post-consent" paradigm. This report argues that 'post-consent privacy' (PCP) is not a rejection of privacy itself, but a profound and necessary rejection of *consent* as the primary, and often sole, mechanism for its protection. It represents a paradigm shift away from a model based on flawed individual, transactional decisions and toward systemic, context-based, and fiduciary models of data governance.

### **The Theoretical Promise vs. Practical Failure of "Notice and Choice"**

The "notice and choice" framework is predicated on the ideal of an informed, rational consumer. Regulations like the GDPR go to great lengths to codify what constitutes valid consent, requiring it to be freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous.1 Data controllers must provide clear, accessible information about their data processing activities, empowering users to make meaningful decisions.1 This legal architecture is designed to place the individual in the driver's seat, giving them ultimate control over their personal information.  
The reality of the digital environment, however, has systematically undermined this ideal. Users are confronted with an endless barrage of lengthy, opaque, and legalistic privacy policies and cookie banners. The cognitive load required to read and comprehend these documents is immense, leading to a well-documented phenomenon known as "privacy fatigue".1 Faced with information overload and complex choices, individuals often disengage, resorting to clicking "accept" without review simply to access a desired service.1 This is compounded by the proliferation of "dark patterns"—user interface designs that are intentionally crafted to nudge or trick users into giving consent they might not otherwise provide.1 The result is a system where consent is manufactured rather than freely given, and the "choice" presented is often illusory. Research has highlighted a "control paradox," where the mere perception of having control over one's data can decrease privacy concerns and increase the willingness to disclose sensitive information, even when actual control over downstream data use is minimal.1  
This dynamic reveals a fundamental tension: the more that legal frameworks have attempted to perfect the consent process by making it more granular and explicit, the more its practical failures have become apparent. The implementation of the GDPR in 2018, intended as the gold standard of consent-based protection, ironically served as a catalyst for its most trenchant critiques. The post-2018 academic and policy discourse is replete with analyses of the negative experiential consequences of the GDPR's consent mechanisms, focusing on user fatigue and the impossibility of managing a constant stream of consent requests.1 It is precisely within this period that the term 'post-consent privacy' and its conceptual cousins began to gain significant traction in academic circles.8 The attempt to legally perfect consent in practice exposed its inherent flaws, thereby creating the intellectual demand for a "post-consent" alternative. The very solution amplified the problem it was meant to solve.

### **The "Consent Burden"**

Recent scholarship has reframed this problem through the lens of the "consent burden".4 This concept, articulated by legal scholar Guy A. Corren, argues that consent mechanisms are not merely tools for empowerment but are also a powerful "burden-shifting technique." Under the guise of granting individuals control, these mechanisms effectively transfer the responsibility for privacy protection—including the burdens of collecting information, processing complex legal terms, making informed decisions, and bearing liability for adverse outcomes—from powerful, well-resourced firms to individual consumers who are ill-equipped for the task.4  
From this perspective, consent is not a right but a regulatory tool that imposes significant cognitive, temporal, and practical costs on individuals. The traditional law-and-economics view holds that consent functions as a form of private ordering that disciplines firms through consumer choice.4 However, in the context of digital markets characterized by vast information asymmetries and network effects, this model breaks down. The "consent burden" framework reveals that instead of empowering users, the current system often disempowers and burdens them, leaving them with little meaningful control or legal recourse.4

### **The "Biggest Lie on the Internet"**

The academic consensus that consent is broken is now so widespread that it has been described as a performative act. Studies consistently show that the vast majority of users do not read privacy policies, do not understand what they are agreeing to, and are often left with no real choice if they wish to participate in the digital world.3 This recognition has fueled the search for alternatives. If consent is a fiction, then any regulatory regime that relies on it as its primary pillar is built on an unstable foundation.  
This report will trace the origins and development of one of the most promising alternatives to emerge from this crisis: 'post-consent privacy'. It will demonstrate that PCP is the logical policy conclusion of a deeper philosophical framework known as Contextual Integrity. By pinpointing the term's first usage, analyzing its conceptual precursors, and comparing it to parallel "beyond consent" models like the data fiduciary framework, this report will provide a comprehensive intellectual history of a concept that is poised to reshape the future of data governance.

## **Section 1: The Emergence and Attribution of 'Post-Consent Privacy'**

The phrase 'post-consent privacy' did not appear monolithically but emerged through a dynamic process of theoretical articulation and policy application. A forensic analysis of its usage reveals a two-track development, originating in the academic work of philosopher Helen Nissenbaum before being adopted and situated within broader policy frameworks by thinkers like Stefaan Verhulst. This progression is preceded by a related, but distinct, discussion in European consumer law concerning the practical challenges of managing data *after* consent has been granted. Understanding these distinct threads is crucial to appreciating the term's originality and conceptual depth.

### **1.1. First Documented Usage: Helen Nissenbaum (2018-2019)**

The earliest available evidence attributes the coining and popularization of the specific phrase "post-consent privacy" to Helen Nissenbaum, a professor of Information Science at Cornell Tech and a leading philosopher of privacy. Her use of the term appears to begin in mid-2018, tellingly, just as the GDPR came into full effect across Europe.  
Nissenbaum's curriculum vitae provides a clear timeline, listing multiple academic presentations in June 2018 with titles that explicitly feature the phrase. These include "Post-consent Privacy and Contextual Integrity" at a Cornell Tech legal conference and "Post-consent Privacy Regulation" at a workshop at Columbia University.10 This demonstrates that from its inception, Nissenbaum linked the concept directly to her long-standing philosophical theory of "Contextual Integrity," positioning PCP not as a new idea out of thin air, but as the regulatory and practical upshot of her two decades of work on the subject.  
The term gained wider academic and public visibility through a March 2019 episode of the "Good Code" podcast, prominently titled "Helen Nissenbaum on Post-Consent Privacy".5 In the episode summary, Nissenbaum is described as "calling for a post-consent approach to privacy, based on what she calls 'contextual integrity'".5 This podcast served to translate her academic argument for a broader audience, cementing the connection between the failure of the consent model, her theory of Contextual Integrity, and the need for a "post-consent" future. The academic relevance of this event is underscored by its inclusion as required listening in a data science ethics course syllabus at the University of Michigan, which explicitly cites the podcast episode.11  
Nissenbaum's use of the term is therefore foundational and deeply theoretical. She introduces "post-consent privacy" to name a paradigm that shifts the locus of privacy protection away from the flawed moment of individual consent and toward an analysis of the appropriateness of data flows within specific social contexts. For Nissenbaum, PCP is the necessary legal and policy embodiment of her philosophical critique of the notice-and-choice model.5

### **1.2. Policy Application: Stefaan Verhulst and Digital Self-Determination (2022-2023)**

A second, distinct track in the term's evolution appears in the work of Dr. Stefaan G. Verhulst, co-founder of The GovLab at New York University. Verhulst incorporates "post-consent privacy" into his broader framework of "Digital Self-Determination" (DSD), a concept aimed at rebalancing power asymmetries in the data ecosystem.9  
In a working paper titled "Operationalizing Digital Self-Determination," first submitted to the academic preprint server arXiv in November 2022, Verhulst discusses the shortcomings of traditional consent mechanisms.9 In this context, he notes that "some have suggested 'post-consent privacy,' while others have suggested the establishment of alternative rights and technologies".9 This paper was later published in the peer-reviewed journal  
*Data & Policy* in April 2023\.15 Similarly, a January 2023 blog post from The GovLab summarizing Verhulst's work mentions the need to explore "alternative consent mechanisms, including those based around 'post-consent privacy'" as one potential solution to rebalance data asymmetries.17  
Verhulst's usage is significantly different from Nissenbaum's. He does not claim to have coined the term. Instead, he references it as an existing idea within a portfolio of potential tools for achieving the larger goal of Digital Self-Determination.9 For Verhulst, PCP is a component, one of several "alternative rights and technologies" that can be deployed to address the problem of "agency asymmetry".9 His work situates PCP within a practical policy toolkit, demonstrating how the theoretical concept can be operationalized in service of a broader data justice agenda. This distinction highlights the maturation of the idea, moving from a theoretical proposal (Nissenbaum) to an integrated policy option (Verhulst).

### **1.3. Practical Precursor: 'Post-Consent Data Management' in EU Consumer Law (2021)**

Even before PCP was being discussed as a theoretical framework, a related but more operational concept emerged from European consumer protection analysis. A February 2021 report from BEUC (The European Consumer Organisation), titled "EU Consumer Protection 2.0," identified a critical gap in the GDPR framework. The authors highlighted "the need to investigate effective post-consent data management entitlements".1  
The report's focus is on the practical challenges consumers face *after* they have already clicked "I agree." It delves into the difficulties of exercising GDPR rights such as the right of access, the right to data portability, and the right to be forgotten, especially in the face of "privacy fatigue" and the "control paradox".1 The concept of "post-consent data management" is concerned with improving the tools and processes available to users to manage their data throughout its lifecycle,  
*within* the existing consent-based system.1  
This term is a crucial precursor because it identifies the same temporal and practical problem that PCP seeks to solve: that privacy protection cannot end at the moment of consent. However, its scope is narrower and less radical. "Post-consent data management" accepts the legitimacy of the initial consent and seeks to bolster downstream rights. In stark contrast, Nissenbaum's "post-consent privacy" fundamentally questions the validity and utility of that initial consent, arguing for a system where privacy is protected irrespective of it. This conceptual evolution—from a practical problem of *management* within the consent model to a theoretical solution of *privacy* beyond the consent model—maps the intellectual journey toward a truly post-consent paradigm.  
The emergence of these concepts can be understood as a direct response to the lived experience of data governance regimes. A practical problem was first identified on the ground by consumer advocates grappling with the aftermath of GDPR (BEUC). Simultaneously, a deep theoretical solution was being named and articulated by a leading philosopher who had long critiqued the system's foundations (Nissenbaum). Finally, that named theoretical solution was integrated into broader, forward-looking policy proposals aimed at systemic change (Verhulst). This demonstrates a healthy and dynamic lifecycle of a policy idea, progressing from problem identification to theoretical formulation and, ultimately, to practical application.

## **Section 2: The Philosophical Bedrock: Helen Nissenbaum and Contextual Integrity**

It is impossible to grasp the meaning and significance of 'post-consent privacy' without a thorough understanding of its philosophical foundation: Helen Nissenbaum's theory of Contextual Integrity (CI). PCP is not a standalone policy proposal but the logical regulatory conclusion drawn from the CI framework. For over two decades, Nissenbaum has developed CI as a robust analytical tool for diagnosing privacy problems in the information age. 'Post-consent privacy' is the name she gives to the type of governance system that would emerge if policymakers took the lessons of CI seriously. This section unpacks the core tenets of Contextual Integrity and demonstrates how it naturally leads to a post-consent paradigm.

### **2.1. The Genesis of Contextual Integrity (2004)**

The theory of Contextual Integrity was formally introduced in Nissenbaum's seminal 2004 article in the *Washington Law Review*, titled "Privacy as Contextual Integrity".19 The theory was born out of a deep dissatisfaction with existing approaches to privacy, which she argued were ill-equipped to handle the novel challenges posed by information technologies.19 Traditional theories, often focused on preventing government intrusion or maintaining secrecy over personal facts, yielded "unsatisfactory conclusions" when applied to phenomena like public surveillance, shopper loyalty cards, and the aggregation of publicly available data.19 These theories struggled to explain why people felt their privacy was violated even when information was gathered in a public space or when no single piece of information was inherently "secret."  
To resolve this, Nissenbaum proposed a radical re-conceptualization of privacy itself. She argued that the right to privacy is not primarily a right to secrecy or a right to control one's information. Instead, she defined it as a right to the **appropriate flow of personal information**.21 This definition shifts the focus away from the content of the information and onto the norms governing its transmission. A privacy violation, in this view, occurs not when information is revealed, but when it flows in a way that breaches the established norms of a specific social context. This framework, which she fully elaborated in her 2010 book  
*Privacy in Context*, provides a way to understand why sharing medical details with a doctor feels natural and proper, while sharing those same details with a marketing company feels like a violation.5

### **2.2. The Core Parameters of Contextual Integrity**

To give this concept analytical rigor, Nissenbaum identified five key parameters that constitute a "contextual informational norm." These parameters function as the building blocks for evaluating any given flow of information 21:

1. **Data Subject:** The individual to whom the information pertains.  
2. **Sender:** The party transmitting the information.  
3. **Recipient:** The party receiving the information.  
4. **Information Type:** The nature of the information being transmitted (e.g., financial, medical, locational).  
5. **Transmission Principle:** The constraints under which the information flows (e.g., with consent, under compulsion, in confidence, for a limited purpose).

A privacy norm is preserved when the flow of information adheres to the expected values for these five parameters within a given social context. A privacy violation occurs when one or more of these parameters are altered in a way that breaches the contextual norm.  
For example, consider the **context of higher education**. A **student** (subject) submits an **essay** (information type) to a **professor** (sender) for the purpose of grading. The professor then shares the grade with the university's **registrar** (recipient) under the **principle of confidentiality** for the purpose of maintaining academic records. This entire flow is consistent with the norms of the educational context and is considered appropriate. However, if the professor were to post the student's essay and grade on a public blog (changing the recipient and transmission principle) or sell the student's academic performance data to a potential employer (a new recipient for a new purpose), this would constitute a breach of contextual integrity, and therefore a violation of privacy. This violation occurs irrespective of any fine print in a university handbook that the student may have "consented" to. The CI framework provides a precise language to explain *why* this flow is inappropriate: it violates the established norms that give the educational context its meaning and purpose.

### **2.3. From Contextual Integrity to a Post-Consent Framework**

The theory of Contextual Integrity provides a powerful critique of the consent-based model of privacy protection. Within the CI framework, consent is merely one possible "transmission principle" among many, and it is not inherently superior or universally appropriate.21 In many contexts, other principles like confidentiality (doctor-patient), need-to-know (national security), or legal obligation (financial reporting) are the governing norms. The problem with the current regulatory regime is that it has elevated consent to the primary, and often only, legitimate basis for data processing, ignoring the rich tapestry of other social norms that have traditionally governed information flow.  
Nissenbaum argues that the modern implementation of consent is "not meaningfully doing anything" precisely because it allows system designers and data controllers to abdicate their ethical responsibilities.21 A developer can secure a one-time, decontextualized "click" from a user and then proceed with data flows that are fundamentally antithetical to the user's context and expectations. The consent acts as a legal shield that legitimizes inappropriate flows of information.21  
This leads directly to the need for a "post-consent privacy" framework. Such a framework would be one where the rules governing data are not determined by a flawed individual decision at the point of collection, but by pre-defined, legitimate contextual informational norms. The regulatory and design burden would shift from the individual user to the data controller. It would no longer be enough to ask, "Did we get consent?" The crucial question would become, "Is this flow of information appropriate for this context, for this purpose, and consistent with its governing norms?"  
Thus, 'post-consent privacy' is best understood as the political and legal translation of the philosophical theory of Contextual Integrity. CI provides the *diagnostic framework* for identifying and analyzing privacy violations by assessing the appropriateness of data flows. PCP provides the *prescriptive vision* for how to regulate those flows: by focusing on upholding the integrity of social contexts rather than relying on the fiction of individual consent. One cannot build a durable PCP regime without the analytical tools of CI to determine what constitutes a legitimate and appropriate flow of information in the first place.

## **Section 3: Conceptual Precursors and the Broader "Beyond Consent" Movement**

'Post-consent privacy' did not develop in an intellectual vacuum. It is a prominent and theoretically robust branch of a much larger intellectual and policy movement that can be broadly termed "beyond consent." This movement is characterized by a shared diagnosis: that the notice-and-choice model of consent is fundamentally broken and incapable of protecting individuals in the age of ubiquitous computing, big data, and artificial intelligence. By examining the parallel concepts and critiques that have emerged from various disciplines, it becomes clear that PCP is part of a widespread convergence of thought, giving the concept both its timeliness and its intellectual force.

### **3.1. The "Beyond Consent" Academic Discourse**

Long before the term PCP was coined, a rich and varied body of academic work was dedicated to deconstructing the limitations of consent. This discourse provides the essential intellectual climate from which post-consent models grew. Scholars from law, media studies, and computer science have systematically dismantled the assumptions underpinning the consent model.  
Key arguments in this literature include the recognition of profound structural power imbalances between individual users and large technology platforms, which render any negotiation of terms impossible.3 The sheer complexity, length, and legalistic nature of privacy policies make the very idea of "informed" consent a practical absurdity.3 This leads to the "illusion of control," where users are led to believe they are managing their privacy when, in fact, they have little to no visibility or power over how their data is used, aggregated, and repurposed downstream.1 A particularly sharp critique focuses on the failure of one-time consent to offer any protection against secondary data usage, algorithmic profiling, and cross-platform tracking, which are the hallmarks of the modern data ecosystem.3  
This critical discourse, advanced by scholars such as Daniel Solove, Julie Cohen, and Jasmine McNealy, has intensified as data processing has become more pervasive and opaque.3 McNealy, for instance, argues for a proactive regulatory framework that places firm boundaries on data collection itself, rather than relying on a flawed, individualistic consent system that unfairly burdens the user.26 This body of work establishes that the problem with consent is not a minor flaw to be patched but a fundamental design failure requiring a paradigm shift.

### **3.2. Use-Based Privacy Controls: Shifting the Regulatory Focus**

One of the most significant conceptual precursors to PCP is the policy proposal for "use-based privacy controls".27 This approach argues for a fundamental shift in the focus of regulation: away from governing data  
*collection* (which is the domain of consent) and toward directly regulating data *use*. The central premise is that in an era of big data, where data is generated passively and its future uses are often unforeseeable at the moment of collection, trying to control collection through consent is a losing battle.27  
This model proposes moving from a paradigm of "privacy by consent" to one of "privacy through accountability".27 Instead of placing the burden on individuals to pre-authorize every potential use of their data, this model places the burden on data users to demonstrate that their use of data is legitimate, ethical, and not harmful. This would involve a new infrastructure of transparency, robust auditing mechanisms, and clear lines of accountability for data users.27  
The concept of use-based controls gained significant traction at high policy levels, having been endorsed by the Obama Administration's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology and the World Economic Forum as a recommended path forward for managing big data privacy.27 This demonstrates a high-level recognition that the consent model was failing and that post-consent alternatives were needed. Use-based controls share a core diagnosis with PCP: front-end consent is an inadequate tool for governing downstream data activities. However, the two concepts differ in their framing. Use-based controls are typically framed in the language of accountability, harm-reduction, and transparency. PCP, drawing from Contextual Integrity, is framed in the language of social appropriateness, norms, and the integrity of social institutions.

### **3.3. The Data Sovereignty and Digital Self-Determination Movement**

A third, parallel movement provides the political and social justice context for the rise of post-consent thinking. Concepts such as "data sovereignty" and "Digital Self-Determination" (DSD) have emerged to address what Stefaan Verhulst calls "agency asymmetry"—the profound power imbalance in the data ecosystem that systematically disempowers individuals and marginalized communities.9  
Proponents of these frameworks argue that individual consent is a wholly insufficient mechanism for correcting this deep-seated asymmetry.15 A single person's "choice" cannot meaningfully alter the practices of a global technology platform. Therefore, these movements advocate for more structural and often collective solutions. Data sovereignty, for example, seeks to place data under the jurisdictional control of a specific political entity (such as a nation-state or an indigenous group), allowing for collective governance.15 DSD, as articulated by Verhulst and the International DSD Network, is a broader principle aimed at embedding and enforcing the agency, rights, and interests of people and communities throughout the entire data lifecycle.9  
This movement is crucial because it connects the technical problem of data governance to broader political goals of empowerment, equity, and justice. While Nissenbaum's Contextual Integrity has its roots in political philosophy, the DSD movement is explicitly activist and policy-oriented, with a particular focus on protecting vulnerable and marginalized groups.13 As seen in Section 1, Verhulst's work demonstrates how a concept like PCP can be adopted as a practical tool in service of the larger political project of achieving Digital Self-Determination.9  
The emergence of PCP is therefore not an isolated academic event but a focal point in a wider, multidisciplinary convergence of critiques against the consent model. Legal scholars have exposed its contractual fictions 4, computer scientists its technical vulnerabilities 25, policy analysts its practical unworkability 27, and social justice advocates its failure to correct systemic power imbalances.9 Each field, using its own language and analytical tools, arrived at the same conclusion: individual consent is a failed mechanism for data governance. 'Post-consent privacy', grounded in the robust theory of Contextual Integrity, has emerged as one of the most clearly articulated and compelling theoretical alternatives to rise from this powerful intellectual convergence.

## **Section 4: A Comparative Analysis of Alternative Governance Models**

As the "beyond consent" movement has gained momentum, 'post-consent privacy' has not been the only alternative governance model to be proposed. Its main conceptual rival, and the subject of significant academic and policy debate, is the "data fiduciary" model. Both frameworks seek to move past the limitations of the notice-and-choice paradigm by imposing higher-order duties on data controllers. However, they do so in fundamentally different ways, stemming from different assumptions about the nature of the relationship between individuals and data processors, and drawing their normative force from different sources. A comparative analysis reveals the critical distinctions between these two leading post-consent approaches.

### **4.1. The Data Fiduciary Model**

The data fiduciary model proposes to regulate the relationship between data subjects and data controllers by casting it as a fiduciary relationship, analogous to those between a doctor and patient, or a lawyer and client.28 In law, a fiduciary relationship exists when a stronger, more knowledgeable party (the fiduciary) holds power over a weaker, more vulnerable party (the beneficiary). The law imposes stringent duties on the fiduciary to constrain their power and protect the beneficiary.28  
Translated to the data context, this model would legally require data controllers (the fiduciaries) to act in the **best interests** of data subjects (the beneficiaries). This overarching duty would encompass three core obligations 28:

1. **Duty of Care:** The obligation to handle data competently and securely, protecting it from breaches and misuse.  
2. **Duty of Loyalty:** The obligation to act solely for the benefit of the data subject and to subordinate the fiduciary's own interests. This would prohibit opportunistic or exploitative data practices, such as using data in ways that manipulate or harm the user.  
3. **Duty of Confidentiality:** The obligation to keep the user's information private and not disclose it without justification.

Prominent proponents of this model, including legal scholars Jack Balkin, Neil Richards, and Woodrow Hartzog, argue that it addresses the core power and information asymmetries that render the consent model ineffective.28 Instead of relying on individuals to protect themselves, the fiduciary model places a positive, enforceable legal duty on companies to act as trustworthy stewards of personal data. This approach aims to remedy the shortcomings of what is sometimes called the "Rights/Obligations Model" (as seen in the GDPR), which can lead to a compliance-checklist mentality, by establishing a higher ethical and legal standard based on trust and loyalty.30

### **4.2. Post-Consent Privacy vs. The Data Fiduciary Model: A Critical Comparison**

While both models are "post-consent" in that they do not rely on individual consent as the primary safeguard, a closer examination reveals a fundamental philosophical divergence. The core difference lies in the source of their normative authority: the fiduciary model is grounded in a duty of **individual loyalty**, while PCP (via Contextual Integrity) is grounded in a duty of **social appropriateness**.

* **Core Duty:** The central command of the fiduciary model is to "act in the user's best interest".28 The central command of PCP is to "ensure the appropriate flow of information consistent with contextual norms".19 These are not interchangeable. An action could be deemed "appropriate" for a given social context even if it is not strictly in the "best interest" of one specific individual. For instance, sharing aggregated and anonymized health data for epidemiological research is highly appropriate for the context of public health, but an individual might not consider it in their personal best interest if they fear any risk of re-identification. Conversely, an action in a user's "best interest" (like a platform hiding negative but accurate news about a user's favorite political candidate) might violate a contextual norm of journalistic integrity or public discourse.  
* **Source of Rules:** In the data fiduciary model, the rules of conduct are derived from an interpretation of the individual's "best interests." This standard is inherently broad and can be vague, likely requiring extensive judicial interpretation over time to give it concrete meaning in different situations.28 In the PCP model, the rules are derived from observable, pre-existing social norms that govern specific contexts like healthcare, education, or commerce.23 The task is not to invent rules based on a vague standard of welfare, but to identify, articulate, and enforce the norms that people already implicitly understand and rely on in their social lives.  
* **Focus of Protection:** This leads to the most critical distinction. The data fiduciary model, despite its structural approach, remains fundamentally **individualistic**. Its primary goal is to protect the individual beneficiary from the actions of the fiduciary. Post-consent privacy, by contrast, is more **structural and social**. Its primary goal is to protect the integrity and purpose of social contexts themselves. The theory of CI argues that privacy is essential for the flourishing of social institutions like medicine, education, and democracy.21 Protecting these contexts is a collective good that may sometimes be in tension with a purely individualistic conception of privacy. The fiduciary model is designed to protect the individual from the collective (the powerful company), while the PCP model can be used to balance individual interests against the collective purposes of a shared social context.

### **4.3. Situating PCP within the Broader DSD Framework**

The work of Stefaan Verhulst on Digital Self-Determination provides a useful, pragmatic lens through which to view this debate. His framework does not treat these alternative models as mutually exclusive competitors in a zero-sum game. Instead, it presents them as part of a portfolio of potential tools that can be deployed to achieve the overarching goal of rebalancing agency asymmetry.9  
In his analysis, Verhulst evaluates data ownership rights, collective ownership models, Personal Information Management Systems (PIMS), and ideas like "post-consent privacy" as different strategies for empowering individuals and communities.9 This suggests a practical policy approach where the "best" governance model might be context-dependent. A data fiduciary model, with its focus on loyalty and preventing commercial exploitation, might be the most appropriate framework for governing consumer-business relationships in e-commerce. A PCP model, based on Contextual Integrity, might be better suited for governing data use in the public sector or in other domains with clearly defined social purposes and norms, such as scientific research or civic engagement. This pragmatic perspective allows policymakers to move beyond a purely theoretical debate and toward designing hybrid systems that leverage the strengths of each model.

| Governance Model | Primary Mechanism | Locus of Responsibility | Core Principle | Key Limitation(s) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Notice & Choice (GDPR-style)** | Individual Consent | Data Subject | User Control / Autonomy | Privacy Fatigue; Meaningless Consent; Fails to address power asymmetry.1 |
| **Use-Based Control** | Accountability & Audits | Data User / Controller | Accountability for Use | Defining "harmful" or "illegitimate" use can be difficult; may be less preventative than collection-based controls.27 |
| **Data Fiduciary** | Fiduciary Duties (Care, Loyalty, Confidentiality) | Data Controller (as Fiduciary) | Loyalty / Best Interest of the Subject | "Best interest" can be vague and hard to enforce; may not resolve conflicts between individual welfare and broader social goods.28 |
| **Post-Consent Privacy (CI-based)** | Enforcement of Contextual Norms | System Designer / Regulator | Appropriateness of Flow | Requires defining and codifying complex social norms; may be less flexible for novel contexts without established norms.19 |

## **Section 5: Synthesis and Implications for Future Data Governance**

The emergence of 'post-consent privacy' and the broader "beyond consent" movement marks a critical inflection point in the history of data governance. It signals a widespread acknowledgment that the foundational model of notice-and-choice has failed to deliver on its promise of meaningful privacy protection in a world of ubiquitous data flows. The intellectual journey of PCP—from a deep philosophical critique of privacy, through the rigorous articulation of Contextual Integrity, to the naming of a new regulatory paradigm and its adoption into forward-looking policy frameworks—provides a roadmap for a more robust and realistic future for data protection. This concluding section synthesizes the report's findings and explores the significant challenges and opportunities involved in operationalizing a post-consent world.

### **5.1. The Journey of a Concept**

As this report has detailed, 'post-consent privacy' is far more than a simple catchphrase. It is the culmination of decades of intellectual work. The journey began with Helen Nissenbaum's foundational critique of consent's inadequacy and her development of Contextual Integrity as an alternative analytical framework.19 This theory redefined privacy not as control over information, but as the right to an appropriate flow of information consistent with social norms. As the practical failures of the consent model became undeniable, particularly in the wake of GDPR, Nissenbaum began to use the term "post-consent privacy" to describe the regulatory system that would logically follow from her theory.5 The concept was then taken up by policy thinkers like Stefaan Verhulst and integrated into wider data justice frameworks like Digital Self-Determination, demonstrating its practical utility.9 This evolution from a philosophical diagnostic to a prescriptive policy vision underscores the concept's maturity and relevance.

### **5.2. Challenges to Operationalization**

Moving from a theoretical concept to an operational governance regime presents formidable challenges. A successful transition to a post-consent paradigm, particularly one based on Contextual Integrity, would require overcoming several significant hurdles:

* **Defining Contexts:** The CI framework rests on the idea of distinct social contexts (e.g., "healthcare," "education," "commerce"). However, the modern digital landscape is characterized by the blurring of these boundaries.31 A single platform can serve as a space for commerce, social interaction, political debate, and even healthcare inquiries. The first major challenge for regulators would be to develop a legally and technically coherent way to define and delineate these contexts in a world of integrated, multi-purpose digital services.  
* **Determining Norms:** Once a context is defined, who determines its governing informational norms? These norms are often implicit, socially constructed, and dynamic. Relying solely on judges or regulators to define them risks creating a rigid and outdated system. A truly legitimate PCP framework would likely require new forms of participatory governance. This could involve processes like "data assemblies" or "citizen juries," where diverse stakeholders—including ordinary citizens, technical experts, and policymakers—are brought together to deliberate and co-design the rules for data use in specific contexts.15  
* **Enforcement:** Enforcing a duty of "appropriateness" is substantially more complex than enforcing a duty to obtain consent. It would require a fundamental shift in the capabilities and mission of Data Protection Authorities (DPAs). Instead of merely checking for the presence of compliant consent banners and privacy policies, DPAs would need to conduct substantive, architectural audits of data systems. They would need the expertise to analyze complex data flows, assess their conformity with contextual norms, and evaluate the ethical implications of algorithmic systems.7 This transforms the DPA from a compliance watchdog into a specialized agency akin to an environmental protection authority, assessing systemic and structural issues rather than procedural formalities.

### **5.3. Recommendations for a Post-Consent Future**

Despite these challenges, the path toward a post-consent future is both necessary and achievable. The most promising approach is not to adopt a single model wholesale, but to construct a hybrid system that leverages the strengths of the various "beyond consent" frameworks.

* **A Hybrid Approach:** The future of data governance will likely be a multi-layered, hybrid system. The debate between the data fiduciary model and PCP should not be seen as a zero-sum game. A robust framework could establish a baseline of **data fiduciary duties**—care, loyalty, and confidentiality—that applies universally to all data controllers in commercial contexts. This would provide a strong, general prohibition against exploitation and negligence.28 Layered on top of this baseline, a more stringent set of  
  **context-specific rules based on Contextual Integrity** could be applied to designated high-risk domains, such as the processing of health data, financial data, children's data, or data used in public-sector decision-making.32 This hybrid model combines the broad protective floor of the fiduciary standard with the nuanced, purpose-driven ceiling of the PCP/CI framework, creating a system that is both comprehensive and adaptable.  
* **From Law to Code:** A post-consent paradigm cannot be realized through law alone; it must be embedded in the very architecture of technology. This requires a renewed commitment to the principles of "Values in Design" or "Privacy by Design".3 The goal should be to create Privacy-Enhancing Technologies (PETs) that do more than just encrypt or anonymize data. The next generation of PETs should be designed to actively enforce contextual norms, building the rules of appropriate flow directly into the system's logic. While Nissenbaum's own work on tools like TrackMeNot and AdNauseam demonstrates the power of obfuscation as a form of protest against surveillance, a true PCP world would move beyond protest and build Contextual Integrity into the core infrastructure of the internet.5  
* **Reimagining Data Protection Authorities:** To oversee such a system, DPAs must evolve. They need to be staffed with interdisciplinary teams of lawyers, ethicists, and computer scientists. Their mandate must expand from enforcing procedural compliance to conducting substantive ethical and technical reviews of data-driven systems. By embracing a more proactive, systemic, and context-aware approach, regulatory bodies can begin to build a data governance regime that is truly worthy of trust—one that protects privacy not through the fiction of a click, but through the structural integrity of our most valued social institutions.
