# my privacy research notebook

this is where i put the stuff i can’t stop thinking about: privacy, data, systems, ethics.  
some of it started with ai prompts, some with real convos or late-night rabbit holes.  
but all of it’s me. reviewed by me. shaped by what i’m curious about. posted because i believe the questions matter, and sometimes the answers too.

use it, fork it, ignore it, remix it. this repo is part research, part wandering.

## why this exists

i think privacy is linked with freedom.  
this notebook is me trying to figure out how privacy shapes society,  
how to build better programs,  
how to bake it into systems and not just policies.  
especially for the folks who don’t usually get to opt in.

this isn’t polished. it’s not a product.  
it’s just where i go to make sense of it all.
