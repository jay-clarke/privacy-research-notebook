# **Privacy has a first principle too**

In *Cybersecurity First Principles*, Rick Howard defines security’s first principle as:

***reduce the probability of material impact due to a cyber-event over the next 3 years.***

That line got me thinking. If privacy had a first principle, what would it be? Compliance frameworks like GDPR, HIPAA, and CCPA aren’t first principles. They’re attempts to establish minimum parameters for privacy programs, necessary to avoid fines, but not essential to the organization’s core purpose (as Howard might argue).

And frameworks like Privacy by Design? They’re foundational, but not *first-principled.* PbD tells us how to build for privacy. The same is true for more technical methodologies like LINDDUN, a privacy threat modeling framework that offers tactics for finding flaws.  They are both a series of methods, not a statement of purpose. They tell us *how* to build privacy, not *why*.

## **Asking why**

When you take each of the seven design principles and sit with them, you start to realize they all depend on something deeper, a reason *why.*

* Proactive, not reactive… toward what?  
* Privacy as default… in service of what outcome?  
* Embedded by design… but to achieve what, exactly?  
Without an underlying purpose, they float. They’re strategies searching for a principle.


If you keep asking “why,” you eventually reach the same root:

**The first principle of privacy:**  
*reduce the probability and magnitude of harm, to people, to trust, and to the organization, from the misuse or unethical processing of personal data.*

This principle provides a pragmatic foundation for risk management. Our first principle serves as the essential, operational starting point for preventing negative outcomes, which can then be layered with a deeper commitment to protecting individual dignity and autonomy.

## **So what does this mean for privacy leaders?**

If that’s true, then privacy success isn’t about the number of assessments completed or the fines avoided.

It’s about outcomes:

* Fewer instances where data use surprises people  
* Reduced likelihood of reputational or regulatory damage  
* Stronger, measurable trust

This reframing shifts privacy from a legal exercise to an *architectural discipline*, the practical application of which is known as Privacy Engineering. It becomes something you can design for, measure against, and continuously improve.

Cybersecurity found its north star in risk reduction. It’s time privacy found its own, one that unites the demands of legal compliance with the core tenets of data ethics: fairness, transparency, and the prevention of harm.

## **Analytical Note: Why Privacy by Design Isn’t a First Principle**

Privacy by Design (PbD) is often treated as if it were privacy’s foundational truth, but it isn’t.  
It’s a framework of methods, not a statement of purpose.

A first principle defines why something exists. PbD describes how to achieve it. 

Take the first of the seven PbD principles: proactive, not reactive. This principle tells us how to behave, anticipate and prevent privacy harms before they occur. But it doesn’t define why we should care. We act proactively to reduce harm to individuals and protect organizational trust. That deeper motive is the first principle itself.

In fact, each of the seven PbD principles carries an implied “why” beneath it:

| PbD Principle | Implied How | Missing Why |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Proactive not reactive** | anticipate and prevent privacy harms early | to reduce harm and preserve trust |
| **Privacy as the default** | minimize collection and sharing by default | to limit potential harm from misuse or over-collection |
| **Privacy embedded into design** | bake controls into systems and processes | to prevent harm efficiently and sustainably |
| **Full functionality (positive-sum)** | balance privacy with business goals | to avoid harm while enabling legitimate use |
| **End-to-end security** | protect data across its lifecycle | to reduce harm from unauthorized access or leaks |
| **Visibility and transparency** | ensure observability and accountability | to prevent harm from asymmetry or deception |
| **Respect for user privacy** | empower users through choice and control | to reduce harm to autonomy and dignity |

Every PbD principle is a *means* toward that end —

**reducing the probability and magnitude of harm to people, trust, and the organization from the misuse or unethical processing of personal data.**

That purpose — the why behind all seven — is what qualifies as privacy’s first principle.  
PbD simply operationalizes it.
